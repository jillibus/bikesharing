## Overview

Roza has a partially completed her dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

I am to help Roza complete her dashboard by presenting the Top 10 bacteria of each of her volunteers in the following ways.
* A *Horozontial Bar Chart* listing the Top 10 Bacteria (OTU Species) found in their Belly Button
* A *Bubble Chart* showing all of the Bacteria cultures found in the samples given by the Volunteer
* A *Gauge Chart* showing the number of weekly scrubbings the volunteer performs on their Belly Button

## Resources
* Data Sources: samples.json
* Software: Visual Basic Studio, JavaScript, Chrome Web Browser, HTML5, CSS, Plotly

## RESULTS

## Application Startup

The applications startup will initialize with all 3 graphs initialized with the sample Volunteer ID 940.

## Interactive Options
                                       
Now the user has an opportunity to search the Volunteers by using the dropdown on the left, and choosing any of the Volunteer ID's.  Once chosen, the charts will all change to represent the new Volunteer's results from the study.

## Hover Feature on Bubble Chart

On the Bubble Chart, the user can use their mouse and hover over any one of the 'bubbles' and the data information will appear.  This will give the user more information on which exact bacteria is represented by the bubble presented.

### Summary

This project definitely dug into my skills with using HTML and playing with colors, fonts and making the charts look different and trying to not clash colors.  The examples we worked through during class time (activities) really helped with setting up the data of each different chart and helped a lot with making the plotting easy to understand.  I spend a lot of time going through the class activities once I go through all of the module to help myself understand the concepts better and they really help a lot.

The JavaScript code doesn't come to me that hard, as I have studied Java in college, but I am still having a bit of difficulty doing the new shorthand notation with the '=>' but I just need more practice.

But breaking down the bar chart first, getting that to populate, then doing the bubble, and getting that to work, then the gauge, definitely helped in understanding doing the 2 parts to get a chart to work.  1) calculating the data then 2) determining the layout.
